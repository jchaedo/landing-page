# Second Project from the Foundations Course: landing-page

In this project I took advantage of the flexbox layout mode that I've recently used to build a landing page from a design.

[Here](https://jchaedo.github.io/landing-page/) is the result.

## The design provided comes in the form of 2 images:
| An image of the complete website | Some details about some of the fonts and colors weâ€™ve used. |
|---|---|
| ![Full design](reference/full-design.png) | ![Color and fonts](reference/color-and-fonts.png) |
