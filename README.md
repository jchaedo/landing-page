# Second Project from the Foundations Course: landing-page

In this project we'll take advantage of the flexbox layout mode we've recently used to build a landing page from a design that has been provided to us.

## The design provided us comes in the form of 2 images:
| An image of the complete website | Some details about some of the fonts and colors weâ€™ve used. |

| ![Full design](reference/full-design.png) | ![Color and fonts](reference/color-and-fonts.png) |
